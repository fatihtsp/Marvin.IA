Marvin.IA is a machine learning collection of object-oriented Pascal primitives (only interfaces and classes). 

**ATTENTION:** We have very new internal (alpha) versions. We also make changes frequently. Please use it at your own risk until we release a stabilized version that will be displayed as a "stable version".

This API is being written in [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi). However, making it compatible with [Free Pascal](https://freepascal.org/) and [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org/) is possible (we are depending on more contributors to make it possible).

**Why**. I want to use Object Pascal (OP) with Machine Learning. The OP is an elegant and very easy language. 
My desire is to contribute to the entire developer community. 
I want to keep and write all project in an elegant, clean and maintainable code using OOP.

**Principles.** The code has some design principles:

* Fully interface-based.
* Memory is released automatically.
* Public methods should be used only for contructors (Create and New) and destructors (Destroy).
* All protected methods are implementations of interface methods.
* All protected methods return an interface instance or primitive type.
* No usage of nil/NULL in arguments or returns.
* No algorithms in constructors.
* No getters and setters.
* No type casting or reflection.
* No procedures or functions, only Interfaces and Objects.

## Dependencies

We are using other packages:

  - Delphi Embarcadero native packages, starting with the XE3 version. 

## How to contribute?

To contribute we suggest following these steps:

1. Fork this project (Click on **Fork** button).
2. Clone your forked project to your local machine.
3. Create a new issue describing about the problem or enhancement that you are going to make.
4. Create a new branch related to this issue. We suggest to use a name like `issue-10` â€” 10 is the issue's ID.
5. Make all the changes necessary and commit.
6. Push the new branch to your Github repository.
7. Go to **Marvin.IA** Github project and click on **Compare & Pull Request**.

**Important:**

- It is important for you create a new branch for each PR. We might need to request some further changes in your work, and having the original PR's code to make these changes is better than working with the whole code.
- Each PR needs to work only in one issue, respecting the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).
- Make sure your branch builds without any warnings/issues.

If you have questions or general suggestions, don't hesitate to submit a new [Github issue](https://github.com/marvinbraga/Marvin.IA/issues/new).
